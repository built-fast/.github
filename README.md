# BuiltFast Open Source

[BuiltFast][] is a privately owned, founder-led hosting company built by long
time web hosting veterans. We're focused on bringing true service back to the
hosting space—helping people succeed online, whether they're running a food
blog, building the next big startup, or anything in between.

We believe in giving back to the developer community that shaped our careers.
We're sharing the tools, scripts, and utilities we build to deliver on our
core principle: we win when you win.

## Our Philosophy

- **Security-first mindset** — Real businesses can't afford shortcuts
- **Quality over speed** — Build it right the first time
- **People over profit** — Long-term relationships matter more than short-term gains
- **Hands-on leadership** — Founded by developers who still love to code

## What You'll Find Here

As we grow, this space will house open-source projects that reflect our commitment to:

- Practical solutions that solve real problems
- Developer experience that doesn't sacrifice security
- Performance tools built from hosting industry experience
- Code that's been battle-tested in production environments

All projects are MIT-licensed and available for anyone to use, adapt, or
contribute to.
