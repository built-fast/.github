# BuiltFast Open Source

We're a founder-led hosting company built by people who've spent decades in the industry and still love to write code. We build [Vector Pro][]-serverless WordPress hosting on AWS Lambda-and the developer tools around it.

This is where we open source the stuff we've built along the way. No vanity projects. These are tools we use in production, and we're sharing them because the developer community shaped our careers and we'd like to return the favor.

## How We Build

- **Simple over complex** - We pick the simplest tool that solves the problem. No complexity we don't need.
- **Security-first** - Real businesses can't afford shortcuts. Secrets management, encryption, and defensive coding aren't optional.
- **Automation everywhere** - "Manually" is a bad word around here. If it can be automated, it should be.
- **Depth over polish** - Working code beats a pretty demo. Everything here has been battle-tested.

## What You'll Find Here

Developer tools, CLI utilities, GitHub Actions, and libraries, mostly focused on hosting infrastructure, deployment automation, and developer experience. All MIT-licensed. [See everything below 👇](#org-profile-repositories).
