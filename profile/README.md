# BuiltFast Open Source

<!-- automation idea: GitHub Action to pull latest blog post title + link and inject it below as "Latest from the blog: [title](url)" -->

We're a founder-led hosting company built by people who've spent decades in the
industry and still love to write code. We build [Vector Pro][] — serverless
WordPress hosting on AWS Lambda — and the developer tools around it.

This is where we open source the stuff we've built along the way. No vanity
projects. These are tools we use in production, and we're sharing them because
the developer community shaped our careers and we'd like to return the favor.

<!-- automation idea: auto-generate a "Repos" section from public repos using the GitHub API, sorted by stars or recent activity. Skip forks and archived repos. -->

## How We Build

- **Simple over complex** — We didn't reach for a framework because we didn't need one. If a shell script solves the problem, that's the right tool.
- **Security-first** — Real businesses can't afford shortcuts. Secrets management, encryption, and defensive coding aren't optional.
- **Automation everywhere** — "I'll do it manually" is a bad word around here. If it can be automated, it should be.
- **Depth over polish** — Working code beats a pretty demo. Everything here has been battle-tested.

<!-- automation idea: scheduled Action that checks all repos for stale issues/PRs (no activity in 30+ days) and posts a summary to a pinned discussion or internal channel -->

## What You'll Find Here

Developer tools, CLI utilities, GitHub Actions, and libraries — mostly focused
on hosting infrastructure, deployment automation, and developer experience. All
MIT-licensed.

<!-- automation idea: badge row auto-generated from repo count + total stars + contributor count using shields.io dynamic badges -->

<!-- automation idea: "Recently shipped" section auto-populated from latest releases across all org repos via GitHub API -->

## Get In Touch

We write about the things we build at [builtfast.dev][devs]. If you
want to talk hosting, open source, or just want to compare Vim configs — we're
around.
